## 🎯 An AI Coding Experiment

**QuickTax is a fully functional tax estimation calculator where 100% of the code was generated by AI under human supervision.** This project demonstrates the capabilities of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in building production-ready applications.

### 🤖 The Experiment

- **AI Partner**: Claude Opus 4 via Claude Code
- **Human Role**: Product vision, requirements, and supervision
- **AI Role**: 100% of implementation, testing, and deployment
- **Result**: A complete, working tax calculator deployed to production

## 🚀 What is QuickTax?

QuickTax is a privacy-focused web application that helps individuals estimate their federal and California state tax payments for the current tax year. All calculations happen locally in your browser - no data is ever sent to any server.

### ✨ Features

- **Real-time tax calculations** for Federal (IRS) and California (FTB)
- **Support for multiple income types**: W-2 wages, dividends, capital gains, RSUs
- **Smart deduction handling**: Standard vs. itemized with SALT caps
- **Estimated payment tracking** with customized schedules for Federal and CA
- **Privacy-first**: All data stays in your browser
- **Mobile-responsive** design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

All technology choices and implementations were made by Claude:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with custom domain

## 📊 AI Development Stats

- **Lines of Code**: ~5,000+
- **Test Coverage**: 97 tests, all passing
- **Components**: 15+ React components
- **Calculation Modules**: Federal, California, and shared utilities
- **Development Time**: Multiple collaborative sessions
- **Human Prompts**: Product requirements and architectural guidance
- **AI Contributions**: All implementation details, algorithms, and optimizations

## 🔍 Code Architecture

Claude organized the codebase with a modular architecture:

```
src/
├── calculators/          # Tax calculation engines
│   ├── federal/         # IRS tax logic
│   ├── california/      # CA FTB tax logic
│   ├── utils/           # Shared calculations
│   └── orchestrator.ts  # Main coordinator
├── components/          # React UI components
├── store/              # State management
└── types/              # TypeScript definitions
```

## 🧪 Testing

Claude implemented comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all tax calculations
- Edge case handling for capital losses, deductions, and more
- Multi-year support with parameterized tests

## 🎨 The Human-AI Collaboration Process

1. **Human** provided the product vision and requirements (PRD.md)
2. **Claude** implemented all features, asking clarifying questions when needed
3. **Human** tested functionality and provided feedback
4. **Claude** fixed bugs, refactored code, and optimized performance
5. **Human** supervised deployment and verified production readiness
