## 🎯 An AI Coding Experiment

**QuickTax is a fully functional tax estimation calculator where 100% of the code was generated by AI under human supervision.** This project demonstrates the capabilities of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in building production-ready applications.

### 🤖 The Experiment

- **AI Partner**: Claude Opus 4 via Claude Code
- **Human Role**: Product vision, requirements, and supervision
- **AI Role**: 100% of implementation, testing, and deployment
- **Result**: A complete, working tax calculator deployed to production

## 🚀 What is QuickTax?

QuickTax is a privacy-focused web application that helps individuals estimate their federal and California state tax payments for the current tax year. All calculations happen locally in your browser - no data is ever sent to any server.

### ✨ Features

- **Real-time tax calculations** for Federal (IRS) and California (FTB)
- **Support for multiple income types**: W-2 wages, dividends, capital gains, RSUs
- **Smart deduction handling**: Standard vs. itemized with SALT caps
- **Estimated payment tracking** with customized schedules for Federal and CA
- **Privacy-first**: All data stays in your browser
- **Mobile-responsive** design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

All technology choices and implementations were made by Claude:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers (web), Xcode (iOS)

## 📊 AI Development Stats

- **Lines of Code**: ~5,000+
- **Test Coverage**: 97 tests, all passing
- **Components**: 15+ React components
- **Calculation Modules**: Federal, California, and shared utilities
- **Development Time**: Multiple collaborative sessions
- **Human Prompts**: Product requirements and architectural guidance
- **AI Contributions**: All implementation details, algorithms, and optimizations

## 🔍 Code Architecture

Claude organized the codebase with a modular architecture:

## 🧪 Testing

Claude implemented comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all tax calculations
- Edge case handling for capital losses, deductions, and more
- Multi-year support with parameterized tests

## 🎨 The Human-AI Collaboration Process

1. **Human** provided the product vision and requirements (PRD.md)
2. **Claude** implemented all features, asking clarifying questions when needed
3. **Human** tested functionality and provided feedback
4. **Claude** fixed bugs, refactored code, and optimized performance
5. **Human** supervised deployment and verified production readiness

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Web Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/denehs/quick-tax.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### 📱 iOS Development

The project includes **two iOS applications**:

#### Native SwiftUI App (Recommended)
A fully native iOS app built with SwiftUI that reimplements the entire tax calculator:

```bash
# Open native iOS app in Xcode
open ios_native/QuickTaxNative/QuickTaxNative.xcodeproj

# Build and run directly in Xcode (Cmd+R)
```

**Native App Features:**
- **100% Native SwiftUI** interface with iOS design patterns
- **Shared calculation logic** with web app (ported to Swift)
- **Modern iOS UX** with custom navigation and real-time updates
- **Optimized performance** and platform-specific features
- **Persistent header** showing real-time tax calculations
- **Navigation buttons** for smooth workflow progression
- **Demo data support** for easy testing

#### Legacy WebView App 
A WebView wrapper that bundles the web application:

```bash
# Build and sync web assets to iOS
npm run build:ios

# Open in Xcode
open ios/QuickTax/QuickTax.xcodeproj

# Or use one-command development
npm run dev:ios  # Builds and syncs, then prompts to open Xcode
```

**WebView App Features:**
- **Universal app** supporting iPhone and iPad
- **Full-screen WebView** without navigation chrome
- **Offline support** with bundled web assets
- **Automated build integration** for easy updates

#### iOS Development Workflow

**For Native App:**
1. Open `ios_native/QuickTaxNative/QuickTaxNative.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Make changes to SwiftUI code directly
3. Build and run in Xcode (Cmd+R)
4. Test on simulator or device

**For WebView App:**
1. Make changes to web code
2. Run `npm run build:ios` to sync to iOS app
3. Build and run in Xcode (Cmd+R)
4. Test on simulator or device

For detailed iOS instructions, see [ios/README.md](ios/README.md).

### 🚀 Deployment

#### Web Deployment (GitHub Pages)
The web version is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when pushing to the main branch:
- GitHub Actions handles the build and deployment
- Available at https://quicktax.nekopanlab.com
- No manual intervention required

#### iOS Deployment
Both iOS apps are deployed separately through Xcode:

**Native SwiftUI App:**
- Direct Xcode builds for development/testing
- Archive and upload for TestFlight beta testing
- App Store distribution (fully native experience)

**WebView App (Legacy):**
- Requires web build sync before iOS deployment
- TestFlight for beta testing
- App Store for public distribution

Both iOS deployments are independent of the web deployment.
