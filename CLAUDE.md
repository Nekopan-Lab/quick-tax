# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Product Specifications Import

The following line imports all product specifications and requirements from the Product Requirements Document:

@PRD.md

**NOTE**: The imported PRD.md contains the complete product specifications for QuickTax, including user flows, tax calculation rules, UI requirements, and deployment instructions. All development work must align with these specifications.

## Important: PRD Update Policy

**CRITICAL**: If any future user prompts or requests conflict with the specifications in PRD.md, you must:
1. Inform the user of the conflict with the existing PRD
2. Ask for confirmation to proceed with the change
3. If confirmed, update PRD.md FIRST to reflect the new requirements
4. Then implement the changes in code
5. Include in commit message: "Updated PRD.md to reflect: [change description]"

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Key Principles
- **PRD.md is the authoritative source** for all product requirements
- Strict separation between UX layer and calculation logic (see PRD Section 6.1)
- All data remains client-side only

### Testing Requirements
- Comprehensive unit tests for all tax calculation functions
- Test coverage must include all scenarios in PRD Section 7

### Deployment Process & Testing

#### Build and Deploy Steps
Follow the deployment requirements in PRD Section 8:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Copy `dist/index.html` to root as `index.html`
3. Copy `dist/assets/` to root as `assets/`
4. Commit and push all changes

#### CRITICAL: Deployment Testing After Code Changes
**You MUST test the deployment locally after EVERY code change to ensure GitHub Pages compatibility:**

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   
2. **Verify build output:**
   - Check that `dist/` directory exists
   - Ensure `dist/index.html` exists
   - Verify `dist/assets/` contains JS/CSS files
   - Check that asset paths in `index.html` are relative (e.g., `./assets/index-xxx.js`)

3. **Test locally as static site:**
   ```bash
   # From project root after build
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000/quick-tax/` (note the `/quick-tax/` path to match GitHub Pages)

4. **Common deployment issues to check:**
   - Missing `index.html` in repository root
   - Incorrect asset paths (should be relative)
   - Build errors that prevent `dist/` generation
   - Missing dependencies in `package.json`
   - TypeScript errors that block the build

5. **Before pushing:**
   - Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
   - Verify the app loads correctly at `http://localhost:8000/quick-tax/`
   - Check browser console for any 404 errors or missing resources

### Development Guidelines

#### Local Testing After Code Changes
**MANDATORY**: After ANY code change, you MUST test BEFORE committing:

1. **Kill any existing dev server:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   nohup npm run dev > dev.log 2>&1 & echo $!
   ```

3. **Verify server is running:**
   ```bash
   sleep 3 && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5173/quick-tax/
   ```
   - Should return HTTP 200 status code

4. **Provide clickable link to user:**
   ```
   âœ… Development server running: http://localhost:5173/quick-tax/
   ```

5. **Wait for user confirmation:** Only commit and push changes AFTER the user has tested and confirmed the changes work correctly.

6. **IMPORTANT**: This testing step must happen BEFORE any git commits. The workflow is:
   - Make code changes
   - Start dev server and verify with curl
   - Provide test link to user
   - Wait for user feedback
   - Only then commit and push if approved

#### Commit Messages
- Always include summary of user's prompt
- Format: "As requested: '[user prompt]'"
- When PRD is updated: "Updated PRD.md to reflect: [change]"

#### Code Standards
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Ensure alignment with PRD specifications
- Maintain test coverage for calculation logic
